# Scam Or Not

This project was created during the Build For Good 2023 Hackathon organised by Open Government Products. Read more about our team and project [here](https://www.build.gov.sg/projects/scamornot).

## Motivation

In 2022, we lost over S$660,000,000 to scammers. The majority of the victims were young people below 40. This shows that scammers have managed to cheat even the young and educated!

Even with ScamShield's protection, many scams still reach us through messaging platforms and SMS. To address the problem at its root, we need to improve everyone's ability to identify scams. The more vigilant we are, the fewer victims of scams.

Hence, our team built Scam or Not, a lightweight, fun and education game to give you not only the skills to recognise scams, but also protect your friends and family from scams.
